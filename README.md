# Thesis - Sentiment Analysis as a feature for a Text Classifier Model

Thesis - NLP based models (Sentiment analysis and Text Classification)
As part of my thesis, I chose the field of NLP as my research area.
Performed Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification on the chosen dataset using Python & Tableau. Implemented both Unsupervised Learning Algorithms for Clustering and Supervised models for predictive analysis.
Tested a hypothesis using various NLP techniques like TF-IDF in combination with many different classification algorithms, comparing their performance and drawing conclusions based on it.

Customer Subscription Prediction models
Using publicly available data from Kaggle implemented prediction models like Decision Tree, SVM etc. to predict customer segments which are likely to subscribe based on the campaign data analysis. Thus applying knowledge from classrooms and gaining hands-on experience on a bank marketing dataset.

Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling
Performed Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling on YouTube comment section for 50 channels and visualised the analysis using Python and Tableau. Training LDA model using vectorisation techniques (BOW, TFIDF), and analysing model results.

•	There are two folders in the repo: ML Code and Converting</br>
•	Converting folder contains code for conversion of JSON data obtained from the AYLIEN repository available from the link: (https://bit.ly/3hKA7R6) into CSV files.</br>
•	ML Code folder has two Jupyter notebook and the CSV file used for this research experiment obtained from post conversion of data.</br>
•	In ML Code Folder the file  ‘Final-Normal.ipynb’ is used to perform text classification work using only text as an input feature.</br>
•	In ML Code Folder the file  ‘Final-Added Feature.ipynb’ is used to perform text classification work using sentiment polarity and subjectivity along with text as an input features.</br>
